                          My name is Sihem.  I came to the United States 6 years ago from the country of Algeria.  I studied computer science there and graduated with a Master's degree in information systems.  When I joined my husband in the United States in 2013, I didn't speak English so I had to start from the bottom of the workforce.  I started by working in retail stores then worked as a school bus driver for the Iowa City Community School District for 5 years.  I recently heard about DeltaV coding school.  I decided to join for the 101 class to see how it was and ended up signing for all of the courses through 401.  It was about time for me to go back to what I am most passionate about; computer science. e: s.azibi@live.fr.

                          Hi, Iâ€™m Yvette Clapp.  I have a MBA in Finance and over 15 years of management experience and over 20 years of leadership experience. I recently completed courses in Data Analysis and Project Management and am currently attending DeltaV Coding School.  At DeltaV, I have completed 101 and 102, am finishing 201, and starting 301 the last week of March. My goal is to get to 401 in the near future.
                          I have proven experience of leading teams through process changes successfully.  Many changes I have been involved in improved the SLAs of the department significantly.
                          Process efficiency is a passion for me.  This passion has generated many process changes that greatly reduces human error and an increase in SLA results.
                          My goal is to continually improve myself and most recently to reinvent myself into a career in website coding where I can utilize my passions to the benefit of the customer.
                          Contacting me is simple!
